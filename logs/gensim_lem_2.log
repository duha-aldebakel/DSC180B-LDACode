using serial LDA version on this node
running online LDA training, 2 topics, 1 passes over the supplied corpus of 100 documents, updating every 60 documents, evaluating every ~100 documents, iterating 50x with a convergence threshold of 0.001000
too few updates, training might not converge; consider increasing the number of passes or iterations to improve accuracy
training LDA model using 3 processes
PROGRESS: pass 0, dispatched chunk #0 = documents up to #20/100, outstanding queue size 1
